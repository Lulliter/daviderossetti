## Welcome to my personal page!

I am a dynamic Italian entrepreneur in the textile industry, a sports enthusiast, and music lover.   

With 25 years of experience in the production of technical fabrics for industrial applications, aquaculture, and agriculture, I have built a strong network of relationships that links clients and partners in Italy and Europe. I see challenges as opportunities for personal and professional growth.

Learn more about my expertise and the reach of my industrial network [**here**](https://daviderossetti.net/network/).

I am based in Pavia (near Milan, in Italy) where I live with my family.  

[I am open to collaborating on new ventures in managerial or commercial [**roles**](https://daviderossetti.net/services) within my field of expertise.]{style="color: #009ff5; font-weight: bold; height:75%"}
